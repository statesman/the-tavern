The Tavern alcohol receipts
===========================

When we wrote that [The Tavern](http://www.austin360.com/entertainment/longtime-austin-bar-the-tavern-now-for-sale-but-might-not-change-much/0Nwy3ifTfq0mzn5NOyiKYJ/) was for sale, I wondered how business was there, and knew I could look at [Mixed Beverage Gross Receipts](https://data.texas.gov/Government-and-Taxes/Mixed-Beverage-Gross-Receipts/naix-2893) to see.

I created a Jupyter Notebook that downloads the data then makes a quick chart of the Total Receipts by year.

To view the code on Github, go inside the `notebooks` folder and click on `tavern-agate.ipynb`.

The project should be repeatable using `requirements.txt` file included.
