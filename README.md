The Tavern alcohol receipts
===========================

When we wrote that [The Tavern]() was for sale, I wondered how business was there, and knew I could look at [Mixed Beverage Gross Receipts]() to see.

I created a Jupyter Notebook that downloads the data then makes a quick chart of the Total Receipts by year.

To view the code on Github, go inside the `notebooks` folder and click on `tavern-agate.ipynb`.

The project should be repeatable using `requirements.txt` file included.
